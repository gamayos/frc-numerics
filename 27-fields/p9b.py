Frontier Q1 resolved: the four roles = bosons (counting) + 3 fermion generations.

The closed ladder of primitive roles (pnp, Prop 7.2) splits 1+3 by the
generative/non-generative distinction:
  - COUNTING creates no new operation (iterating the last role returns to it):
    the unique NON-generative role.  Bose statistics IS occupation-counting (n in a
    mode = a count), and the gauge connection is a phase count -> counting = BOSONS.
  - ADDITION, MULTIPLICATION, EXPONENTIATION each build a new operation
    (translation, scaling, powering): the three GENERATIVE roles = the three
    FERMION GENERATIONS (Pauli forbids occupation-counting -> not the counting role).
Hence exactly 3 generations = 3 generative roles; no 4th (the ladder closes).
This is the degree-3 of the P9 Galois lead.  The role ladder (each role iterates
the previous) orders the generation masses: gen3 (powering) heaviest = the top.
