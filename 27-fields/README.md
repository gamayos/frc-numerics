# Validation suite — *Standard-Model Interactions over Finite Substrate*

**Repository:** <https://github.com/gamayos/frc-numerics/tree/main/27-fields>

This folder holds the computational verification for *Standard-Model Interactions over Finite Substrate* (`../main.tex`). The scripts are standalone, deterministic, take no input, and print a human-readable verdict; all exit non-zero on any failed check.

## Framed-rational discipline (and audit)

Every script carries a one-line `# framed-rational status:` banner at the top, in one of three classes:

- **EXACT** — every asserted check is performed in integer, modular `𝔽_p`, `𝔽_{p²}`, or cyclotomic arithmetic. No floating point enters an asserted claim (a `float()` may appear only to format an exact rational for display). Nothing exceeds the totality `Ω`.
- **MIXED** — an exact framed-rational core, with continuum constructs (`exp`, `log`, trig, `√`, Haar integrals, measured data) confined to clearly-labelled `[approx]` / degenerate-idealisation comparisons (the Tier 2/3/5 correspondence and phenomenology, or comparison to PDG constants). The exact claim never depends on the float part.
- **[APPROX]** — by construction a continuum / degenerate-idealisation comparison (the finite-window correspondence to compact Yang–Mills, or a dimensional-transmutation estimate). These are not exact framed-rational claims; they are the observer-chart reading.

This is the corpus rule: an exact claim lives in finite, finite-field, or cyclotomic arithmetic; the continuum enters only as an explicitly labelled profinite/degenerate-idealisation approximation, and no realized magnitude exceeds `Ω`.

**Audit result (this pass).** All 28 scripts run and pass. Two scripts that asserted an *exact* claim through a floating-point step were reframed to be genuinely framed-rational:

- `enumerate_maxwell.py` — the Maxwell-uniqueness **dimension** was read from `numpy.linalg.eigh` (float eigenvalues, thresholded). It is now the exact corank of the integer constraint Gram over `𝔽_p` (Gaussian elimination in a large prime field, balanced lift); the continuum dispersion-symbol reading that classifies the operator as the transverse projector is kept, clearly, as the `[approx]` part (and its basis count is cross-checked against the exact corank).
- `p4.py` — the V−A character cancellation `Σ_τ ζ_N^{2δτ}` was evaluated with `cmath` (float, `abs(·)≈0`). It is now the exact geometric-series value: `N` if `N∣2δ`, else exactly `0`, in integer arithmetic (no `cmath`).

`audit_finitism.py` remains the standing cross-check that the load-bearing EM / O1 claims do not secretly depend on a float or continuum step.

Class counts: **EXACT 15, MIXED 11, [APPROX] 2.**

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- `numpy` and `sympy` (only some scripts need them — see the table)
- no other dependencies; no network, no data files

```bash
pip install numpy sympy
```

## Running

```bash
python3 p1.py                                   # one script
for f in *.py; do echo "=== $f ==="; python3 "$f"; done   # whole suite
```

All scripts exit 0 and complete in seconds.

## Script → claim map

"Paper result" refers to the labelled results in `../main.tex`. "Status" is the framed-rational class above.

## Representative expected output

- `enumerate_maxwell.py` → `dim(T&L&C&G) = 2`, exact `𝔽_p` corank; one relevant Maxwell operator (projector match `~2×10⁻⁷`) + one irrelevant `O(k⁴)` artifact.
- `ew1.py` → `sin²θ_W = 3/8`, `ρ = 1` exactly.
- `weak_current.py` → left `= N=q+1`, right `= 0` exactly (`q=3,5,7,13`); `G_F` comparison `[approx]`.
- `koide.py` → 5/5 framed-rational `𝔽_p` checks; measured `Q=0.66666` tagged `[approx]`.
- `strongcp.py` → 20/20: Hermitian `det ∈ 𝔽_p` (`θ̄=0`), `[M_u,M_d]≠0` (CKM free).
- `p4.py` → left `= N`, right `= 0` (exactly).
- `audit_finitism.py` → action `= 1 − √2/2 = 1 − (ζ₈+ζ₈⁻¹)/2`, a cyclotomic number, not a float.

## Conventions and notes

- **Exact where exact.** Claims the paper marks exact are computed in integer, `𝔽_p`, `𝔽_{p²}`, or cyclotomic arithmetic and verified exhaustively over a basis or group, never by sampling. `audit_finitism.py` cross-checks that no exact claim depends on a float or continuum step.
- **Continuum readings are labelled.** Coulomb `1/4πr`, the `4π`/`2π` geometric constants, the RG running, the dimensional-transmutation scales, the compact-group string tension, and comparisons to PDG constants are degenerate-idealisation `[approx]` readings (the finite-window correspondence and phenomenology), reported as such; the cross-scale running and the absolute scales are **Ω-hard**.
- **Nothing exceeds Ω.** No realized magnitude exceeds the totality; super-`Ω` quantities, where they appear in the argument, are formal (controlled) counts, not computed values.
- **Determinism.** No script's asserted result depends on randomness; results are reproducible bit-for-bit.
- **Orientation.** The convention `𝕀 = g^{−π/2}` is used throughout (see `p10.py`); do not flip it.
