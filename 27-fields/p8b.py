P8 hard push: simple unification forced a-priori (relational ontology + spinor matter).

Two established programme principles do the work:
  (1) MATTER IS A SPINOR (the spinorial architecture, as for the weak doublet & chirality):
      the internal frame is ONE rank-5 Hermitian frame V=C^5 over K, whose spinor is the
      generation (the 16); not two separate colour/isospin frames (which would give
      reducible matter and unforced hypercharges).
  (2) RELATIONAL ONTOLOGY (no absolute frame; the R2 principle behind gravity's diffeo
      gauge and the EM U(1)): the decomposition V = C^3(colour) + C^2(isospin) is a basis
      choice, not absolute, so the cell-local reframings that MIX colour and isospin are
      gauge symmetries.  The group of those reframings is the OFF-BLOCK of su(5) -- the 12
      X,Y leptoquarks -- so the gauge group is the full SU(5), extended to SO(10) by the
      spinor.  The product SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1) would require the 3+2 split to be ABSOLUTE,
      which the relational ontology forbids.
We verify the generator bookkeeping that identifies the X,Y with the colour-isospin
reframings, and the SO(10) spinor irreducibility.
