P8: simple unification -- is the rank-5 frame gauged as a simple group?

Architectural argument (lead): matter is the single spinor of the single rank-5
internal frame (Section 7).  The spinor = exterior algebra Lambda^* C^5 = the
SO(10) chiral spinor 16, IRREDUCIBLE under SO(10) (simple) but REDUCIBLE under the
product SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1) into 1 + 5bar + 10.  Matter being ONE irreducible spinor
forces the simple group; the product is the broken-phase remnant.  SO(10) (not just
SU(5)) is favoured: the nu^c singlet lives in the SO(10) 16 but not the SU(5)
5bar+10, and Section 7 derived nu^c.  Predictions: proton decay suppressed if the
unification (X,Y) scale is the substrate/Planck scale; the P1 near-miss is a
prediction of completing structure.
