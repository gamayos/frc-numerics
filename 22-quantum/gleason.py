"""22-quantum gleason suite: uniqueness of the pair tally (prop:gleason), EXACT.
On the Q4 core: kernels K: Q4 -> Z[i] with K(d^-1) = conj(K(d)) (two-way),
tally-valued on basis and point states. Claims:
(U1) the four character kernels eta_r(d) = i^{rd} span, over nonneg tallies,
     exactly the admissible kernels (exhaustive, coefficients 0..3);
(U2) Fourier inversion recovers nonneg integer c_r for every admissible kernel;
(U3) a kernel with any c_r negative or non-integer violates tally-valuedness
     on some state (witness produced);
(U4) covariance under channel repositioning pins K to a multiple of one eta_r.
Exhaustive on Q4 (d=4); cross-checked on the F13 core instance.
No floats, no RNG."""
