P7: fermion masses and mixings -- what the substrate fixes, and what is open.

(a) Mechanism: the Yukawa is the Higgs-mediated bridge between the drive-aligned
    (left, P4) and Frobenius-conjugate (right) branches; m = y v, v the spinor-frame
    misalignment (EW-1 Higgs).  The mass connects the two chiralities the weak force
    separates.
(b) Seesaw: the Section-7 singlet nu^c takes a Majorana mass at the unification
    scale (P1); the light-neutrino mass m_nu ~ y^2 v^2 / M_R brackets the observed
    ~0.05 eV for M_R near the GUT scale -- a correct-order prediction.
(c) b-tau Yukawa unification from the SO(10) 16: m_b = m_tau at M_GUT, and QCD
    running enhances m_b, giving m_b/m_tau ~ 2-3 at low energy (observed 2.4).
(d) Hierarchy (LEAD): masses are winding-overlap coherences; the top is the
    maximally coherent fermion (y~1); the inter-generation hierarchy is
    Froggatt-Nielsen-like in the winding distance, reducing to P9.
The precise spectrum and the CKM/PMNS mixings (the flavour problem) are NOT
derived here; they reduce to the three-generation winding assignments (P9).
